<h3> RNMC Social </h3>

<h4><em> A back-end multi-user blog app practice project </em></h4>
<br>

<div class="text-justify">

  <h4> Overview </h4>

  <p> The idea behind this project is to let users create and join groups and post comments in them, what would be the foundation of blogging social networks like Reddit or Facebook. </p>

  <p> Signup, login, logout, authentications, group creation and joining, posting and removing comments are all handled by Class-based views using Django framework. Since my aim here is to work at wiring the back-end, the front-end is a bit too basic, so sorry for that. It was made with Bootstrap 3 and some custom CSS. The background animation is a reference example whose credits are stated down below. </p>

  <p> As for my other projects, please feel free to go to <a class='github' href="https://github.com/RenzoMurinaCadierno"><strong>my GitHub page</strong></a> to check them out. I am still on my learning tracks, so you will see new projects frequently. I specialize in Python and Javascript, and whatever I upload is normally related to web, game and app developing, or Python scripting for multiple purposes. </p>

  <p> I have put together this example up following Jose Portilla's proposed exercise on his 'Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp' Udemy course. Definitely check it out if you want to learn this framework, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap and Python basics from scratch. Also, the background theme was copied from Thibaut Foussard's example at https://codepen.io/Thibka/pen/mWGxNj. Awesome creation, by the way. </p>

  <p><strong> Thank you for reading and for taking your time to check this project out! </strong></p>

  <h4> Instructions </h4>

  <p> Nothing new other than what you basically do in a social network, pretty much intuitive.

  <ul>

    <li> Create a user using the "Signup" option. </li>
    <li> Once the user is created (or if you already have a registered user), jump into your account with "Login". </li>
    <li> Check all available groups on "Groups". Click on them to join or leave. </li>
    <li> Post on the groups you desire using "Post".</li>
    <li> If you desire, you can create your own group by tapping on "Create group". </li>
    <li> While cheking a group's posts, you can click on the user who commented to be able to see all of their comments. It also applies to yourself. You can also view your posts by tapping on your user icon in the navbar.</li>

  </ul>
